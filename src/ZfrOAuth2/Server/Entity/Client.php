/**
 * Client entity
 *
 * A client is an application that makes protected resources on behalf of the resource owner (eg. a user
 * for instance). A client can be, for instance, a server or a browser
 *
 * There are two types of clients: the public and confidential ones. Some grants absolutely require a client,
 * while other don't need it. The reason is that for public clients (like a JavaScript application), the secret
 * cannot be kept, well, secret! To create a public client, you just need to let an empty secret
 *
 * Note that the client implements TokenOwnerInterface, because in the "ClientCredentials" grant type, the
 * owner of the tokens is actually the client itself
